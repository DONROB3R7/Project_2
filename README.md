## Introduction

<br>

**Landing page**: Users are able to see which films are showing when by browsing our carousel list of cards.
<br>
**Login / Register page**: Users are required to provide email address and password to continue to bookings.
<br>
**Bookings page**: Once users are logged in, users can select a movie they want to book for by selecting the seats they want to reserve and confirming the registration. 
// payments will be offsite external service provider due to GDPR.) Users will not be able to select reserved seats.
<br>
**Admin page**: Accessed through a landing page link. Is an inversion of the landing page. The carousel will `read` from the database:
    -   Title
    -   Date of show
    -   Number of seats booked
Admin will be able to `create` and `edit` films and, `create`, `delete`, and `edit` shows. Admin access will be hard coded.
